# Image-Recognition-with-Neural-Network-Research
This research utilized partial dataset of the original 2013 Kaggle Dogs vs. Cats Challenge to test alternative neural network structures on image recognition. Two benchmark experiments were conducted in 3 x 2 factorial design respectively to decide the structure of a dense neural network and the structure of a convolutional neural network. The selected dense neural network achieved 71.5% predictive accuracy on test set while the selected convolutional neural network achieved 85.3% predictive accuracy on the test set. The CNN model outperforms DNN model in predictive accuracy and loss at the cost of longer training time. The impact of optimizer, number of hidden layer, and number of hidden nodes on the performance of DNN was discussed, as well as the impact of number of convnet and pooling layers, filter size, and kernel size on the performance of CNN.
